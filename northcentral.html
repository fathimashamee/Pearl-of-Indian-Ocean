            <img src="images/ruwanveli.jpg">
            <p>The Ruwanweli Maha Seya, also known as the Mahathupa is a stupa in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. Two quarts or one Dona of the Buddha's relics are enshrined in the stupa, making it the largest collection of his relics anywhere. It was built by Sinhalese King Dutugemunu in c. 140 B.C., who became king of Sri Lanka after a war in which the Chola King Elāra was defeated. It is also known as Swarnamali Seya, Svaṇṇamāli Mahaceti and Rathnamali Seya. This is one of the "Solosmasthana" and the "Atamasthana". The stupa is one of the world's tallest ancient monuments, standing at 103 m and with a circumference of 290 m. The original stupa had been about 55 m in height and was renovated by many kings. The Kaunghmudaw Pagoda in Sagaing, Myanmar is modelled after this stupa The Mahavamsa contains a detailed account on the construction and the opening ceremony of the stupa. The stupa was covered by jungle as of the 19th century. After fund raising efforts by a bhikkhu, it was renovated in the early 20th century. </p>

            <img src="images/thissa weva.jpg">
            <p>Tissa Wewa, an artificial reservoir, was built by Devanampiya Tissa in order to increase the water supply to his capital city of Anuradhapura. Only Panda Wewa and Abhaya Wewa are older. The embankment of Tissa Wewa is 2 miles long and 25 feet high. Among other uses, the reservoir supplied water to Tissa's Royal Gardens. In later centuries, Tissa Wewa and the other lakes were enlarged and integrated into a regional network of irrigation canals.</p>

            <h2>Lovamahapaya</h2>
            <img src="images/lova.jpg">
            <p>Lovamahapaya is a building situated between Ruwanweliseya and Sri Mahabodiya in the ancient city of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is also known as the Brazen Palace or Lohaprasadaya because the roof was covered with bronze tiles. In ancient times, the building included the refectory and the uposathagara. There was also a Simamalake where the Sangha assembled on Poya days to recite the sutra of the confessional. The famous Lohaprasada built by King Dutugemunu, described as an edifice of nine stories, was a building of this class. One side of the building was 400 ft in length. There are 40 rows, each row consisting of 40 stone pillars, for a total of 1600 pillars. It is said that Lovamahapaya was adorned with corals and precious stones. It is believed that it took six years for the construction of the building and the plan was brought from the heavens. The building was completely destroyed during the reign of King Saddhatissa. Whilst the Jetavanaramaya, Abhayagiriya and Ruwanwelisaya were taller structures, the Lovamahapaya remained the tallest building of the island for over a millennium between 155BC and 993AD.</p>
