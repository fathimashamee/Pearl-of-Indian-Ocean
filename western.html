Private boats are also present well equipped with life jackets and safety equipment and follow strict safety procedures to ensure a smooth tour for the guests. The boat ride also offers light refreshments throughout the journey.
                
                A densely populated region also surrounds the area with sprawling rice paddy fields, coconut plantations, grasslands, fishing and agricultural grounds. Many hotels and resorts around the lagoon serve delicious and fresh seafood for the guests.</p>
