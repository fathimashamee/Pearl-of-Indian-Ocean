            <img src="images/yahapahuwa.jpg">
            <p>Yapahuwa Rock Fortress is historically one of Sri Lanka’s most important sites.

            <h2>Dolukanda Rajamaha Viharaya</h2>
            <img src="images/dolukanda.jpg">
            <p>Hike will be hard for beginners. (Takes about 1.3hr to reach to top.) Also a nice place if you plan on camping the night. There are ponds at the top but recommend to take enough water to drink.
                Will be harder to get down under rain, so plan your way down before rains. Also note that you will be entering this hike through a monastery. So no shouting and please don't waste the place with your litter.
                Safe travels </p>
